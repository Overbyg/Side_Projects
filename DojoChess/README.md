Just download the repo and open up the .html file in a browser and you will have a (mostly) perfect chess game to enjoy.

Future Updates:

I can't get the checkmate and check functions to work. I will need to implement a subscription data link to the board somehow to tell in real time if the pieces are in position to check or if their moving puts the king in check. Also to recognize when the king is in Checkmate or Stalemate. Right now you are forced to kill the king to win the game.
