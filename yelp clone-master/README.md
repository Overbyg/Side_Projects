# C# Yelp Clone

This yelp clone was built in the ASP.NetCore Framework with MVC5 and Entity Framework with PostgresSQL database.

To run download the github repo and (if you have the necessary .Net components downloaded) type "dotnet watch run" in the appropriate folder in you console/terminal.

You will need postgresSQL installed to have full functionality, but with the EF LINQ commands it will create the appropriate modals automagically. God bless code first.
